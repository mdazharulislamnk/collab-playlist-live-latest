Deploy to Vercel
Go to https://vercel.com → Add New Project
Import your GitHub repo
Framework Preset: Vite (or React)
Root Directory: select your frontend folder (e.g. client/), not the server folder
3) Set the environment variable on Vercel
Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add:

Name

Code
VITE_API_URL
Value

Code
https://collab-playlist-live-latest.onrender.com
Environment: Production (and Preview too if you want)

Then Redeploy (important—env vars apply only after redeploy).

4) Verify in the deployed site
Open DevTools → Network and confirm:

Requests go to https://collab-playlist-live-latest.onrender.com/api/tracks
Not localhost:4000
Also confirm SSE:

https://collab-playlist-live-latest.onrender.com/api/stream (EventStream stays open)
5) If you get CORS error
In your backend (server.js) temporarily allow all (you already do):

js
app.use(cors());
